# Volmex.Finance V1 Bug Bounty

## Overview
This bug bounty program is designed to bolster the professional audits Volmex V1 has undergone.

## Scope
This Program is limited to the vulnerabilities affecting Volmex V1 in the following contracts:

[Volmex Core](https://github.com/volmexfinance/volmex-core/)

The following are not within the scope of the Program:

- Any contract located under [volmex-core/test](https://github.com/volmexfinance/volmex-core/tree/master/test).
- Bugs in any third party contract or platform that interacts with Volmex V1.
- Vulnerabilities already reported and/or discovered in contracts built by third parties on Volmex V1.
- Any already-reported bugs.

Vulnerabilities contingent upon the occurrence of any of the following activities also are outside the scope of this Program:

- DDOS attacks
- Frontend bugs
- Spamming
- Phishing
- Automated tools (AWS, etc.)
- Compromising or misusing third party systems or services.

## Rewards

Rewards will be allocated based on the severity of the bug disclosed and will be evaluated and rewarded at the discretion of the Volmex Labs team. For critical bugs that lead to any loss of LP funds, rewards of up to $50,000 will be granted. Lower severity bugs will be rewarded at the discretion of the team. 

## Disclosure

Any vulnerability or bug discovered must be reported only to the following email: [security@volmexfinance.com](security@volmexfinance.com).

The vulnerability must not be disclosed publicly or to any other person, entity or email address before Volmex Labs has been notified, has fixed the issue, and has granted permission for public disclosure. In addition, disclosure must be made within 24 hours following discovery of the vulnerability.

A detailed report of a vulnerability increases the likelihood of a reward and may increase the reward amount. Please provide as much information about the vulnerability as possible, including:
- The conditions on which reproducing the bug is contingent.
- The steps needed to reproduce the bug or, preferably, a proof of concept.
- The potential implications of the vulnerability being abused.

Anyone who reports a unique, previously-unreported vulnerability that results in a change to the code or a configuration change and who keeps such vulnerability confidential until it has been resolved by our engineers will be recognized publicly for their contribution if they so choose.

## Eligibility

To be eligible for a reward under this Program, you must:

- Discover a previously unreported, non-public vulnerability that would result in a loss of and/or lock on any ERC-20 token on Volmex V1 (but not on any third party platform interacting with Volmex V1) and that is within the scope of this Program. Vulnerabilities must be distinct from the issues covered in the CertiK or Coinspect audits.
- Be the first to disclose the unique vulnerability to [security@volmexfinance.com](security@volmexfinance.com), in compliance with the disclosure requirements above. If similar vulnerabilities are reported within the same 24 hour period, rewards will be split at the discretion of Volmex Labs.
- Provide sufficient information to enable our engineers to reproduce and fix the vulnerability.
- Not engage in any unlawful conduct when disclosing the bug, including through threats, demands, or any other coercive tactics.
- Not exploit the vulnerability in any way, including through making it public or by obtaining a profit (other than a reward under this Program).
- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, interruption or degradation of Volmex V1.
- Submit only one vulnerability per submission, unless you need to chain vulnerabilities to provide impact regarding any of the vulnerabilities.
- Not submit a vulnerability caused by an underlying issue that is the same as an issue on which a reward has been paid under this Program.
- Not be one of our current or former employees, vendors, or contractors or an employee of any of those vendors or contractors.
- Not be subject to US sanctions or reside in a US-embargoed country.
- Be at least 18 years of age or, if younger, submit your vulnerability with the consent of your parent or guardian.

## Other Terms

All reward decisions, including eligibility for and amounts of the rewards and the manner in which such rewards will be paid, are made at our sole discretion.

The terms and conditions of this Program may be altered at any time.
